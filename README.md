Creating this graphic was to demonstrate the popularity of bike riding times. There is a clear increase during morning times, specifically 6-9 AM, and 4-7PM. This is a great oppertunity for marketing or sales near the locations of the riders.

This graphic demonstrates the majority of riders are not longer than an hour. This most likely represents short trips, perhaps on the way to work or on the way home. The longer trips could represent either marathon training or a longer rent time for the bikes.
